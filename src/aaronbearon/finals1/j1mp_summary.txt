Part 1 - RetailItem Class
    A retail grocery store has different types of items.
    Each item type, has a name, unit price, and a certain number of copies on the shelf.
    The program will create several sample item objects based on the RetailItem class,
        store appropriate data in them, and print them.

    Rules:
        Item object:
            Name (String)
            Count (int)
            Price (double)

    Input:
        "Jacket", 12, 59.95
        "Designer Jeans", 40, 34.95
        "Shirt", 20, 24.95

    Output:
        Print the data

Part 2 - CashRegister Class
    Buy an item created with the RetailItem class.
    The program should store the unit price, quantity, subtotal, tax, and total in a CashRegister object and print them.

    Rules:
        subtotal = quantity * unit price
        tax = subtotal * 0.06
        total = subtotal + tax

    Input:
        item (with price $50.00)
        quantity 2

    Output:
        Subtotal: $100.00
        Sales Tax: $6.00
        Total $106.00

Part 3 - Sales Receipt Class
    Buy an item created with the RetailItem class.
    The program should use an object of the SalesReceipt class to make a file with the data mentioned in part 2.

    Rules:
        See part 2

    Input:
        See part 2

    Output:
        SALES RECEIPT
        Unit Price: $50.00
        Quantity: 2
        Subtotal: $100.00
        Sales Tax: $6.00
        Total $106.00

        Write all that to an output file.
