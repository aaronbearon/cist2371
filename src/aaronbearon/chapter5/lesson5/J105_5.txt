/*
The code above is a palindrome checker program.

6: Gets a line of input from the user.
7: Sets a starting checkpoint for the input.
8: Sets an ending checkpoint for the input.
9: Sets the possibility of a palindrome to true until proven false.
10: Causes a loop to run as long as the starting checkpoint is before the ending checkpoint.
11: Checks the current pair of characters for a mismatch.
12: If a mismatch occurs, this is not a palindrome...
13: Exit loop.
16, 17: Move checkpoints inwards to next pair.
