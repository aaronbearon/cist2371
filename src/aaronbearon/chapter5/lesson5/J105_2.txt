/*
The code above produces a 9x9 multiplication table as a grid with a top row
of column labels and a left column of row labels.

6: Causes j to iterate from 1 to 9 inclusive.
7: Prints the digits 1 through 9 as the top row of column headers.
8: Prints a vertical line to separate the column headers from the column body.

10: Causes i to iterate from 1 to 9 inclusive.
11: Prints the current row heading.
    This happens on every iteration of the outer loop.
12: Causes j to iterate from 1 to 9 inclusive.
13: Prints the multiples of i for the current row, by multiplying i and j.
16: Prints a line break for a new row.
