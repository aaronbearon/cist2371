Part 1 - Calculating Sales

1. User Input

- int product (1-5)
- int count (>0)

2. Algorithm

- Print instructions
- Input and Sum up Products
    - Initialize int totalPrice to 0 cents.
    - Start a while loop that runs until product is 0.
    - Input each Product
        - Prompt the user for the initial product (or sentinel).
            - Validate input with inputProduct() function.
        - Prompt for count.
            - Validate input with inputCount() function.
        - Get the item price
            - Use a switch statement on product (1-5) to look up itemPrice.
        - Calculate currentPrice = itemPrice  * count.
        - Add currentPrice to totalPrice.
        - Display running total.

- Display totalPrice

3. Output:

- int totalPrice (in cents, but format to look like dollars and cents)

Part 2 - Account Savings Checking

1. User Input

- int accountNumber
- String accountType
- int minimumBalance
- int currentBalance

2. Algorithm

- Print instructions

- Input all the data
    - Prompt the user to enter the accountNumber, accountType ('S' or 'C'), minBalance, and currentBalance.
    - Validate accountType input using a loop to ensure it's 'S' or 'C'.

- Get new balance
    1.  If accountType is "Savings"
        -   If currentBalance >= minimumBalance:
            -   newBalance = currentBalance * 1.04
        -   Else (Balance < minimumBalance):
            -   newBalance = currentBalance - 10.00

    2.  Else If accountType is "Checking"
        -   If currentBalance > (minimumBalance + 5000.00):
            -   newBalance = currentBalance * 1.05
        -   Else If currentBalance >= minimumBalance:
            -   newBalance = currentBalance * 1.03
        -   Else (Balance < minimumBalance):
            -   newBalance = currentBalance - 25.00

    3.  Else (Invalid Account Type):
        -   Print "Unknown error!" and exit the program.

- Display Results
    - Print a formatted table with a header and a separator line.
    - Use a custom padding function line up columns.

3. Output
    - int customerNumber
    - String accountType
    - int currentBalance (printed with leading $)
    - double newBalance (printed with leading $ and trailing cents)

Part 3 - Parking Charges

1. User Input
    - double hours (Sentinel value to end input: 0)

2. Algorithm

- Print instructions

- Process each Customer
    - Initialize int total to 0 (to store total receipts in cents).
    - Loop indefinitely, identified by Customer i.
    - Input the customer hours
        - Validate that input hours is between 0 and 24 (inclusive) using a loop.
        - If hours is 0, exit the loop (sentinel).
    - Compute Price
        - Convert hours to an integer representing whole or partial hours
            - int intHours = (int) Math.ceil(hours).

        - If intHours < 3:
            - int current = 200 ($2.00)

        - Else If intHours > 19: (The maximum charge limit)
            - int current = 1000 ($10.00 - max charge)

        - Else (intHours is between 3 and 19):
            - Calculate the charge: int current = 200 + 50 * (intHours - 3)

        - Add current to total.
        - Display running result of current and total charges.

- Display results
    - Display the final total

3. Output
    - double current / 100.0 (for each customer) (leading $ and trailing cents)
    - double total / 100.0 (running and final total) (leading $ and trailing cents)
